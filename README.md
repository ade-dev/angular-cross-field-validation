# Angular multiple Cross-Field Validation

A demo angular application for my article at: http://clade.co.uk/adewole/blog/angular/cross-field-validation

I wanted to share my experience and gather feedback on creating an Angular cross-field validator that compares and validates the values of multiple groups of input fields and their relative confirm input fields. The app is built in Angular 10 â€“ strict mode, for both reactive and template-driven forms.
