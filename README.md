# An angular custom cross-field validator for multiple groups of form input fields

A demo angular application with unit and e2e tests, for the article at: http://clade.co.uk/adewole/blog/angular/cross-field-validation

I wanted to share my experience and gather feedback on creating a custom Angular cross-field validator that compares and validates the values of multiple groups of input fields and their relative confirm input fields. The app is built with Angular â€“ strict mode, for both reactive and template-driven forms.
